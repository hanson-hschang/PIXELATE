## ðŸš€ Developer Setup

### I. Prerequisites
This project uses uv for fast and reliable Python package management during development. 
Install uv first:

```bash
# Install uv with pip
pip install uv
```

### II. Development Installation
Clone the repository and install with dev dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanson-hschang/pixelate.git
cd pixelate
uv sync --all-groups --all-extras
```

<details>

<summary>Detail of Development Installation</summary>

This installs the package in editable mode along with all development dependencies including testing, linting, formatting, and type checking tools.

**Development Tools:**
- pytest (testing framework)
- pyupgrade (syntax upgrades)
- mypy (static type checking)
- types-toml, types-Pillow (type stubs)
- black (code formatting)
- isort (import sorting)
- flake8 (linting)
- autoflake (remove unused imports)
- bandit (security checking)
- pre-commit (git hooks)

**Pre-commit Hooks:** Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before commits
```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

**Testing:** Run tests with pytest
```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest -c pyproject.toml
```

**Linting**

If you encounter formatting issues during development or in CI/CD, use these commands to automatically fix them:

```bash
uv run pyupgrade --exit-zero-even-if-changed --py311-plus src/**/*.py tests/**/*.py # Upgrade syntax to Python 3.11+
uv run black --config pyproject.toml src tests          # Fix code formatting
uv run isort --settings-path pyproject.toml src tests  # Fix import sorting
uv run autoflake --in-place -r src tests # Remove unused imports

# Check what would be changed without making changes:
uv run flake8 src tests  # Check for linting issues
uv run black --diff --check --config pyproject.toml ./
uv run isort --diff --check-only --settings-path pyproject.toml ./
uv run autoflake --check -r src tests
uv run mypy --config-file pyproject.toml src tests         # Check static types
```

</details>

### III. Code Quality
- **Formatting**: Code is automatically formatted with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/)
- **Import sorting**: Imports are sorted with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)
- **Linting**: Code is linted with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/)
- **Type checking**: Static type checking with [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/)
- **Security**: Security checks with [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/)

### IV. CI/CD
This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration with separate workflows:
- **Test workflow**: Tests run on Python 3.11+
- **Linting workflow**: Ensures code adheres to linting standards
- **Security workflow**: CodeQL security scanning with write permissions for security results
- All checks must pass before merging to main branch


### V. Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): short description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
